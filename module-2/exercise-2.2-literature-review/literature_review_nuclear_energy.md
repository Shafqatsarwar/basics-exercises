# The Future of Nuclear Energy: Emerging Conflicts and Debates

## A Structured Literature Review

---

## Executive Summary

Nuclear energy stands at a critical inflection point in 2025-2026, experiencing renewed political and commercial interest driven by climate imperatives and AI data center power demands, yet facing persistent structural challenges that limit its expansion. While global nuclear generation reached a record 2,677 TWh in 2024, nuclear's share of commercial electricity continues declining at 9%—down from 17.5% in 1996—with growth concentrated almost entirely in China while Western nations grapple with aging fleets, decommissioning backlogs, and economic uncompetitiveness against renewables. The central conflict shaping nuclear's future is no longer simply safety versus emissions, but rather an urgent decarbonization timeline clashing with nuclear's inherent characteristics: high costs, decade-long construction lead times, and unresolved waste management—pitting it against rapidly scaling renewable alternatives that now outinvest nuclear 21-to-1 globally.

## Key Findings by Theme

### 1. Economic Competitiveness and Cost Dynamics

The economic case for nuclear energy has deteriorated significantly relative to renewable alternatives. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for nuclear ranges from US$0.148-0.53/kWh, while utility solar costs US$0.038-0.045/kWh and onshore wind US$0.037-0.047/kWh—making nuclear 3-10 times more expensive than competing low-carbon sources (World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2025). This cost disparity manifests in investment patterns: global renewable energy investment in 2024 was 21 times higher than nuclear investment, with solar and wind capacity additions reaching 565 GW combined versus nuclear's net addition of just 5.4 GW.

Construction cost overruns have become endemic to the industry. France's Flamanville-3 EPR reactor started operation in December 2024—12 years behind schedule—at US$25.6 billion, six times the original US$4.3 billion estimate. The Vogtle expansion in the United States ballooned from $21.8 billion to $53 billion, while the UK's Hinkley Point C doubled from $35.8 billion to $69.7 billion. These patterns reinforce investor skepticism and utility reluctance to commit to new large-scale nuclear projects.

### 2. Small Modular Reactors: Promise Versus Industrial Reality

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)—defined as reactors of 300 MWe or less with factory-fabricated modular components—represent the industry's primary response to cost and scalability challenges. The theoretical advantages are compelling: lower capital outlay per unit, serial production economies, deployment flexibility for remote locations and small grids, and passive safety features enabling smaller emergency planning zones (World Nuclear Association 2025). Over 100 SMR designs are in development globally, with significant government support programs in the US, UK, Canada, and China.

However, the gap between SMR hype and industrial reality has widened over the decade since the concept gained prominence. Ten years after the first World Nuclear Industry Status Report SMR chapter, no SMR has achieved commercial operation in the West despite US$15.4 billion in combined public and private funding. NuScale holds US design certification but has no reactors under construction anywhere. European SMR startups Newcleo and Naarea failed due to cash shortages and insolvency. Argentina's CAREM-25 was declared "not economically competitive" with construction halted in 2024. China's HTR-PM, the most advanced SMR project, reduced capacity by 25% (from 200 MW to 150 MW) for undisclosed reasons with no reliable performance data publicly available.

The fundamental challenge remains: SMRs require economies of series production to achieve cost competitiveness, but serial production requires demonstrated demand that doesn't exist without cost competitiveness—a circular dependency that has yet to be broken.

### 3. The Waste Management Impasse

Nuclear waste remains the industry's most intractable long-term problem. As of December 2024, over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods sit in temporary storage across the United States alone, with over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground (Ohio State University 2025). Globally, approximately 263,000 tonnes of used fuel remain in storage, with no permanent disposal facility operational in any major nuclear nation (World Nuclear Association 2025).

The United States has paid utilities $11.1 billion since 1998 in damages for failing to provide permanent waste disposal as legally mandated, with projected liabilities reaching $44.5 billion (CNBC 2025). Yucca Mountain, designated in 1987 as the national repository, was defunded and mothballed in 2010 after decades of political and legal controversy. Finland is nearing completion of the world's first permanent underground repository, with Sweden building a similar facility, but these remain exceptions rather than the norm.

Emerging solutions include deep borehole disposal (pioneered by startup Deep Isolation Nuclear) and fuel reprocessing/recycling (companies like Oklo, Curio, and Shine Technologies extracting uranium from spent fuel). Oklo is constructing a $1.68 billion reprocessing facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, expected in the early 2030s. However, these technologies remain unproven at commercial scale, and reprocessing introduces proliferation concerns that complicate international adoption.

### 4. Safety Concerns in a Changing Risk Landscape

The safety debate has evolved beyond the historical focus on operational accidents to encompass new risk dimensions. The Fukushima Daiichi disaster, now 14 years past, remains unstable: only 0.9 grams of an estimated 880 tons of fuel debris has been removed (approximately one-billionth of the total), 94,000 cubic meters of contaminated water has been discharged into the ocean amid international controversy, and nearly 25,000 residents remain displaced as of February 2025 (World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2025). Food safety monitoring has been described as "opaque and disorganized," with 29% of tested wild boar meat exceeding radiation limits.

A new safety dimension emerged from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where the IAEA has warned of escalating nuclear safety risks as energy infrastructure faces repeated strikes. Ukraine's nuclear safety condition reached its worst state since September 2024 following Russian power grid attacks, raising concerns about reactor security in active conflict zones (IAEA 2025).

Despite these high-profile concerns, routine safety metrics in stable jurisdictions remain strong. Switzerland's nuclear installations recorded 36 reportable events in 2024 (up from 24 in 2023) but overall met safety requirements (ENSI 2025). France's nuclear facilities maintained satisfactory safety levels with considerable mobilization around fourth-generation reactor performance (ASN 2025). The World Nuclear Association maintains that accident risk is "low and declining," with consequences "minimal compared to other industrial hazards"—a characterization contested by nuclear critics who emphasize low-probability, high-consequence tail risks.

### 5. Geopolitical Dependencies and Supply Chain Concentration

Nuclear energy's supply chain exhibits extraordinary concentration in ways that create strategic vulnerabilities. Russia remains the dominant international supplier, with 27 reactor units under construction abroad (20 across 7 countries), and controls significant portions of the nuclear fuel services chain including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, and fuel assembly for Soviet-designed VVER reactors (19 in the EU, 15 in Ukraine) (World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2025). The EU maintains no sanctions on the Russian nuclear sector—a stark indicator of dependency despite broader economic sanctions following the Ukraine invasion.

Rosatom's EU market share in 2024 ranged from 16-24% for uranium services (down from 23.5-38% in 2023), but mutual dependencies persist: Western companies including Framatome and Siemens Energy supply critical instrumentation and control technology to Russian reactors. Sanctions have caused delays in Bangladesh, Egypt, and Türkiye projects, with reports of 10,000 of 14,000 Russian workers in Türkiye returning home unpaid.

This concentration extends beyond Russia. China now accounts for over half of global nuclear construction activity (32 of 63 reactors under construction), and 95% of all nuclear construction is carried out by nuclear weapon states or their controlled companies. The geographic concentration of construction—zero active nuclear construction anywhere in the Americas from Alaska to Cape Horn—raises questions about the industry's global viability absent state subsidy and strategic commitment.

### 6. The Climate Imperative Versus Deployment Reality

Nuclear energy's role in climate mitigation has become increasingly contested as the urgency of decarbonization intensifies. Proponents emphasize nuclear's status as a low-emission baseload power source capable of providing electricity, district heating, and high-temperature industrial heat (IAEA Atoms4NetZero 2024). The argument rests on nuclear's capacity factor advantages and grid stability contributions that intermittent renewables cannot provide without substantial storage.

Critics counter that nuclear's deployment characteristics are fundamentally misaligned with climate urgency. The average construction time for reactors under construction is 5.3 years, with many projects experiencing multi-year delays. To maintain current nuclear capacity through 2030 would require increasing the annual startup rate by 2.5 times (from 6.9 to 17.3 units per year)—a pace the industry has never demonstrated. Meanwhile, solar and wind can be deployed at scale within electoral cycles, with China alone adding 278 GW of solar capacity in 2024 versus 3.5 GW of nuclear.

The temporal mismatch has sharpened with the emergence of AI data center power demands. Tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon are driving unprecedented electricity demand growth, creating pressure for rapid low-carbon deployment. Nuclear's decade-long lead times are incompatible with data center development cycles, while battery storage costs dropped 40% in 2024 alone, reaching a tipping point for grid integration that enables higher renewable penetration (World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2025).

## What We Still Don't Know

### Unresolved Technical Questions

1. **SMR commercial viability**: Can any SMR design achieve cost competitiveness through serial production? Will the first Western commercial SMRs (NuScale, Rolls-Royce, GEH BWRX-300) actually be built, or will they follow Westinghouse's 2014 suspension pattern?

2. **Advanced fuel cycles**: Will reprocessing and recycling technologies (Oklo, Curio, Shine) prove economically viable and politically acceptable given proliferation concerns? Can HALEU (High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium) supply chains be established at scale outside Russia and China?

3. **Deep geological repositories**: Will Finland's Onkalo and Sweden's Forsmark facilities demonstrate long-term safety and public acceptance sufficient to enable replication elsewhere? Can the US break its 40-year waste disposal impasse?

4. **Fusion timelines**: While outside this review's scope, commercial fusion's perennial "30 years away" claim—if ever realized—would fundamentally alter nuclear's role. Recent breakthroughs warrant monitoring but don't affect 2030-2050 planning horizons.

### Unresolved Policy Questions

1. **Carbon pricing impact**: Would meaningful carbon pricing change nuclear's economic calculus sufficiently to enable new construction, or are cost differentials with renewables too large?

2. **Energy security tradeoffs**: How will nations balance nuclear's fuel security advantages (years of fuel on-site) against supply chain dependencies (Russian fuel services, Chinese construction)?

3. **Intergenerational equity**: What ethical frameworks should govern waste management decisions that impose millennial-scale burdens on future generations? How should discount rates be applied to costs incurred centuries hence?

4. **Conflict resilience**: What security arrangements are adequate for nuclear facilities in geopolitically unstable regions? Should nuclear deployment be restricted to zones with low conflict risk?

### Unresolved Market Questions

1. **Data center demand sustainability**: Is AI-driven electricity demand growth a temporary spike or sustained structural shift? Will nuclear's baseload characteristics command premium pricing in markets with high renewable penetration?

2. **Insurance and liability**: How should nuclear accident liability be priced and allocated? Current frameworks (Price-Anderson Act in the US) socialize tail risks—would full cost internalization make nuclear uninsurable?

3. **Decommissioning funding**: With 218 reactors closed and only 23 fully decommissioned (10.5%), will existing decommissioning funds prove adequate? Who bears shortfalls when operators become insolvent?

## Conclusion

The nuclear energy debate has shifted from a binary pro/anti framing to a more nuanced assessment of nuclear's role within a diversified low-carbon portfolio. The central question is no longer whether nuclear is "good" or "bad" in the abstract, but whether its specific characteristics—high capital intensity, long lead times, concentrated supply chains, unresolved waste, and low operational emissions—align with the urgent decarbonization timeline demanded by climate science and the rapid deployment cycles required by emerging electricity demand centers.

The evidence reviewed suggests that nuclear's future depends less on technological breakthroughs than on political choices: whether societies are willing to socialize nuclear's costs and risks while privatizing its benefits, whether waste management impasses can be broken after seven decades, and whether SMRs can escape the circular dependency of requiring serial production to achieve cost competitiveness while lacking the demand that cost competitiveness would create.

What is clear is that the window for nuclear to claim a major role in 2050 decarbonization is narrowing. Every year of delay in SMR commercialization, every billion dollars invested in nuclear rather than renewables, and every ton of waste left in temporary storage represents a choice—with consequences that will outlive current decision-makers by centuries.
